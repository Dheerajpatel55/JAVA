 * 1. The Thief and the Jewelry Shop üíéü¶π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
A thief breaks into a jewelry shop with a backpack that can carry at most W kg. Inside the shop,
 there are different types of jewelry, each with a certain weight and value. The thief can take 
 fractions of jewelry if needed.

Problem:
How should the thief fill his backpack to maximize the total value of the stolen items?

Input:

jewelry[i] = (weight, value), where each piece has a weight and a value.
The backpack has a capacity of W kg.
Input:  
W = 10  
jewelry = [(5, 60), (3, 50), (4, 70)]  
Output:  
Maximum Value = 130  

Hint: The thief should greedily take items based on the highest value-to-weight ratio.
